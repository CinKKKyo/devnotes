devnotes
========

Welcome to the devnotes wiki. I'm leaving a few obscure technical resolutions here where not appropriate for StackOverflow etc., which might help anyone searching the web for specific error messages, niche topics etc.

Other wiki alternatives seem technically shaky, and I'm not wanting to deal with handling a PHP project over trivial notes. Since GitHub is likely going to be around for a long time to come I'm making unconvential use of a repo.

See the [wiki](https://github.com/lmmx/devnotes/wiki) on the right â‡’
