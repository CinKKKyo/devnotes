devnotes
========

Welcome to the devnotes wiki, where I'm leaving a few perhaps obscure technical resolutions where not appropriate, for anyone searching the web for specific error messages, niche topics etc.

Other wiki alternatives seem technically shaky, and I'm not wanting to deal with PHP for trivial notes, so since GitHub is likely going to be around for a long time to come I'm making unconvential use of a repo.

See the [wiki](https://github.com/lmmx/devnotes/wiki) on the right â‡’
